## About the Project

This project was created with the objective of develop of a system based on knowledge in Prolog to provide a solution to the problem of the wolf, the sheep and the cabbage (WSL):

*Once upon a time a farmer went to a market and purchased a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage. On his way home, the farmer came to the bank of a river and rented a boat. But crossing the river by boat, the farmer could carry only himself and a single one of his purchases: the wolf, the goat, or the cabbage.*

*If left unattended together, the wolf would eat the goat, or the goat would eat the cabbage.*

*The farmer's challenge was to carry himself and his purchases to the far bank of the river, leaving each purchase intact. How did he do it?*
